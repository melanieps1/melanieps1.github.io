	  <p>Hi there!  I'm Melanie, and I like being creative and traveling.</p>
  <br>
	  <p>I just moved back to Lexington, Kentucky from Boulder, Colorado.  I enjoy hiking, camping and mountain biking after work and on the weekends, and exploring new corners of the world as much as possible. I've backpacked through 26 countries so far and have visited all 50 US states, always with plans to go and explore more.</p>
  <br>
	  <p>I am really excited to be a part of the Awesome Inc U coding bootcamp this fall!  I originally started out as a UX designer but turned into a Product Owner for a software startup last year.  Now, onto learning the engineering side of things!  I can't wait to see where this will lead me next.</p>
