      <p>Hi there!  I'm Melanie, and I like being creative and traveling.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am currently living in Boulder, Colorado but will be moving (back) to Lexington, Kentucky next week!  I enjoy hiking, camping and mountain biking after work and on the weekends, and exploring new corners of the world as much as possible. I've backpacked through 26 countries so far and have visited all 50 US states, always with plans to go and explore more.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Being a part of the Awesome Inc U coding bootcamp this fall is a really exciting experience!  I originally started out as a UX designer but turned into a Product Owner for a tech company last year.  Now, onto learning the engineering side of things!  I can't wait to see where this will lead me next.</p>
