			Hi there!  I'm Melanie, and I like being creative and traveling.
	  		<br>
	  		<br>
			I also enjoy hiking, camping and mountain biking in my spare time, and exploring new corners of the world as much as possible. I've climbed 10 14ers in Colorado, backpacked through 26 countries (so far!) and have visited all 50 US states, always with plans to go and explore more new places.
	  		<br>
	  		<br>
			Currently, I am going through a web development bootcamp until December with <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/bootcamp/">Awesome Inc U</a> in Lexington, KY USA.  With previous backgrounds in Design and Product at tech startups, <strong>my biggest passion is finding simple solutions for complicated problems.</strong>  After the bootcamp, I am hoping to pair those backgrounds with my newfound skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.  I can't wait to see where this will lead me next.

	  		Thanks for stopping by!  Please check out my design and development <a href="/projects">projects</a> and feel free to <a href="#">contact me</a>, I would love to hear from you!
