		  <p>I am really excited to be a part of the Awesome Inc U coding bootcamp this fall!  I originally started out as a UX designer but turned into a Product Owner for a software startup last year.  Now, onto learning the engineering side of things!  I can't wait to see where this will lead me next.</p>
