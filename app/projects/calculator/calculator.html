		<p>One of the first projects that we did during the JavaScript portion of our web developer bootcamp was create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

		<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Become more familiar with JavaScript by creating a calculator that performs basic math operations.</p>

		<p>I have since finished up some of the features that we started in class and worked on styling the interface.  Check out my <a href="https://github.com/melanieps1/js-calculator">GitHub repo</a> or the video below to see the result!</p>
