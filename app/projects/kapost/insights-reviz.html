		<p>The analytics section of our software needed some serious love.  Check out what we were dealing with:</p>

		<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Modernize the Insights app and make data visualizations more digestible for our customers, so they can more easily gather the analytics data they need.</p>

		<p>I worked with our Insights Product Manager to brainstorm and whiteboard potential concepts for the charts we had and the new charts we wanted to build.</p>

		<p>After the brainstorming stage, I brought this idea to early hi-fidelity mock-ups to be tested with both our internal sales team and some of Kapost's customers.</p>

		<p>We did three rounds of internal testing with various team members and roles, and had three external customer calls and visits, consistently iterating from their feedback of what statistics users are looking for, how granular they should be and in what order to show them.</p>
