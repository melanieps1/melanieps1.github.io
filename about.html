			<p>Hi there!  I'm Melanie, and I like being creative and traveling.</p>
	  	<br>
			<p>I just moved back to Lexington, Kentucky from Boulder, Colorado in September 2017.  I enjoy hiking, camping and mountain biking in my spare time, and exploring new corners of the world as much as possible. I've backpacked through 26 countries so far and have visited all 50 US states, always with plans to go and explore more places.</p>
	  	<br>
			<p>Currently, I am going through a web development bootcamp with Awesome Inc U until December.  I am hoping to pair my UX design and product owner backgrounds with my newfound skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.  I can't wait to see where this will lead me next.</p>
